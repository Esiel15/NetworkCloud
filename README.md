This is the final project of the 6th semester "Operating Systems II" subject. The objective is create a distributed file storage system, 
allowing to the connected computers to share and delete files as if they where local. It has to be fault tolerant, wich means if a 
connected computer gets unavailable, the system can continue operating, with restricted but imperceptible functions.
